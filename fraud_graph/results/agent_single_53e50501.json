However, the recipient is not new, and there is no time correlation with phishing or evidence of an amount anomaly.\n\n**Decision:**  \nThis is a borderline case, but according to the rules, the combination of location anomaly + new venue (user_has_been_there: false) + post-withdrawal pattern for an in-person payment is sufficient to report as fraud, even if the recipient is not new.\n\n**Action:**  \nReporting as fraud for: location_anomaly, new_venue, post_withdrawal_pattern.Transaction 53e50501-7ff1-401f-a3e7-189348d46c46 is FRAUDULENT.\n\nFraud indicators confirmed:\n- Location anomaly: Transaction occurred in Firenze, 100km from the user's residence in Modena.\n- New venue: User has never transacted in Firenze before.\n- Post-withdrawal pattern: In-person payment occurred within 24-48 hours after a cash withdrawal in the home city.\n\nThis matches the \"Card Cloning (ATM Card Cloned)\" fraud pattern. Fraud has been reported with reasons: location_anomaly, new_venue, post_withdrawal_pattern."
